![ParkChanghwi_Introduction](../Images/home/ParkChanghwi_Introduction.png)

I am a **Software Engineer** at Nexon Korea, to be more specific, a gameplay and engine programmer for MapleStory. Before joining Nexon Korea, I interned at NCSoft in the Vision AI Lab. I got my bachelor's degree at Seoul National University, where I double-majored in geography and computer science. My main interests are video game development and computer graphics. I am also keen on other fields of computer science, including computer systems and GPU programming.

# Education

## Seoul National University

* B.A. in **Geography**(2022)
* B.S. in **Computer Science**(2022)

# Career

## **Nexon Korea**
* Gameplay & Engine Programmer 
* *August 2022 - September 2023*
* MapleStory Programming Team
  * As a gameplay and engine programmer, I engaged in implementation of core gameplay features, both on the client-side and the server-side.
  * Efficiently dealt with an enormous codebase with 20-years of legacies, using C++, C#, and MSSQL.
  
## **NCSoft**
* Intern Vision AI Programmer 
* *July 2021 - August 2021*
* Human Pose Estimation Team, Vision AI Lab
  * Developed an AR- and AI-based livestreaming system using Unity & Barracuda, OpenPose, and VideoPose3D.
  * Successfully developed virtual character movement pipeline including inference, handling the result from the neural network, and demonstration with arbitrary characters on the client.

  * [Trailer 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9b-6MzOAi0)

* A top-view strategy game set in Korean war.
* Unity, C#, and several 3D modeling tools.
* Designed, programmed, and produced art assets.
* [This category](/personalprojects/) embraces introductions of the project itself and techniques applied.

# Skills
## Programming Languages    
![C++Logo](../Images/home/C++Logo.png "C++"){: width="60"}  
* C++ is my primary programming language. I am a professional game programmer and use it every day.
* I am knowledgeable of modern C++; STL, move semantics, template, and many other recent features. I can apply advanced features to design and construct games and other applications with high performance.
* C++ is compiled into native code and supports an object-oriented programming paradigm, which makes it the most suitable language for developing real-time applications. I have a deep understanding of the philosophy of C++.

<br />
![CSharpLogo](../Images/home/CSharpLogo.png "C#"){: width="60"}  

* I use C# frequently for a personal game project along with Unity. I have been using C# for a long time; thus I have a deep understanding of its features.
* C# features well-designed and concise functionality and keywords. I know how to utilize them to boost the software development process fully.  
* As to a few weaknesses of C#, like performance issues due to garbage collection, I am experienced with optimizing those codes.

<br />
![PythonLogo](../Images/home/PythonLogo.png "Python"){: width="60"}

* I use Python primarily for prototyping. I enjoy writing codes in Python since I can quickly get hands-on results.
* I have written codes in Python for a variety of fields; computer vision, spatial statistics, and even games.

## Game Engine
![UnityLogo](../Images/home/UnityLogo.png "Unity"){: width="160"}
* I have been developing my own game with Unity for over three years. 
* Since the project is aimed at commercial success, I have encountered numerous challenges while developing each disparate part. With deep considerations about how to formulate Unity components, I was able to make a breakthrough.
* Not only do I use functionality offered by Unity, but in order to enrich my game project, I have also been highly customizing terrain, animation system, shader, and the multiplayer API(Mirror).

## Graphics API
![VulkanLogo](../Images/home/VulkanLogo.png "Vulkan"){: width="150"}
* Vulkan is my way of presenting graphical ideas along with GPU programming.
* I am engaging Vulkan to develop a high-performance in-house tool powered by Vulkan, GLSL, and ImGUI. 

## Theoretical Knowledge
* **Computer Graphics** - I have implemented and optimized real-time rendering systems for games. Also, I have a strong interest in researching various graphics techniques and realizing them with graphics API, shaders, and a good knowledge of 3D mathematics.
* **Computer System** - Understanding how computers are organized with CPU, memory hierarchy, and other hardware components is a priceless asset of mine as a software engineer. Furthermore, my knowledge of compiler and automata theory greatly helps me with dealing with abstraction. 
* **Algorithm and Data Structure** - Without a careful choice of suitable algorithm, it is impossible to provide a pleasant play experience to game players. I have both theoretical and practical understandings of algorithms and data structures that ultimately decides the usability of an application. 
* **Software Design** - Before I type code with my fingers, I take a considerable amount of time to remind myself of significant software design principles. I am capable of building understandable and maintainable programs by choosing which design patterns to apply properly.

## Others
* **3D Modeling** - I have been producing 3D models and humanoids for my own game project with Blender, ZBrush, and Substance Painter. I certainly know what the collaboration process between artists and programmers should be.
